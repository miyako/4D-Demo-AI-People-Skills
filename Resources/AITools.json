        "description": "Retrieves persons using vector comparison. It is mandatory to call this function with required arguments. This function returns the top matching records after vector search based on input arguments, but keep in mind that this is a vector search, so results may not be absolutely accurate. It is mandatory to check that returned results are relevant to the search intent, by analyzing the detailed data returned. Vectorized information are the following: identity (name, email, phone, gender, birth date), skills (hard and soft skills, expertise level, years of experience), jobDetails (job titles, hr notes, hire date, billing rate), address (street info, city, state, country).",

              "description": "English phrase precisely describing a profile to search. This will be vectorized and compared against a vector in database. The phrase must describe a person, ie identity and/or HR information and/or skills and level reached and/or address. If you want to search people living in New York' or in 'Chicago', use multiple calls to tool_PersonSearchByVector: for example: one call with 'people living in New York' and another call with 'people living in Chicago'. This way you can retrieve persons living in either city. Same goes for skills, jobDetails and identity. You can however use more complex phrases in a single call if it makes sense that a given person have them all, for example: 'senior Frontend developer hired approximately in 2020 expert in React and Javascript and Agile methodology and living in north america'  Be careful to avoid terms that have not been vectorized. Another key point: Each person has only one address in the database. If a search involves multiple locations (countries, cities, etc.), a separate search must be performed for each location, and then the results should be merged. Never search for people who would be located in several different places within the same tool call, as this cannot exist in the database. Example of embedding: 'Isabella Moretti is a female person. she was born on 1991-05-23. she can be contacted via her email address isabella.moretti@globesoftint.com or by phone on +39 349 864 2931.
